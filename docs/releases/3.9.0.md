## New Features

 * RRule-Based Recurrence: Task recurrence is now powered by the iCalendar standard (RFC 5545), allowing for more complex and flexible
   recurring task schedules. A migration assistant will help you update your existing tasks to the new format.

   individual completions of recurring tasks.
 * "Show" Dropdown in Filter Bar: A unified "Show" dropdown has been added to the filter bar, providing enhanced filtering options for your
   tasks.
 * Insert Tasknote Link Command: A new command has been added to insert a link to a tasknote, streamlining your workflow.
 * Dedicated Inline Task Folder Setting: You can now specify a dedicated folder for inline tasks, with support for {{currentNotePath}} to save
   tasks in the same folder as the current note.
 * "Show Due Dates When Scheduled" Setting: A new setting allows you to display due dates for scheduled tasks in the calendar view.
 * Compact Filter Bar: A more compact filter bar option is now available for a cleaner interface. (Thanks, amithkk!)
