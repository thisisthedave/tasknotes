# Release Notes: 3.9.1

New Features

 * GitHub Issue Templates: Added templates for bug reports and feature requests to streamline issue submission and ensure all necessary information is provided.

Bug Fixes

 * Pomodoro Timer: Fixed an issue where a long break would incorrectly start after the first work session. The timer now correctly schedules a short break as intended.
 * Task Creation: The "Magic Wand" (Natural Language Processing) now properly fills the context and tag fields in the task creation modal. Default contexts and tags are preserved if none are found in the natural language input.
