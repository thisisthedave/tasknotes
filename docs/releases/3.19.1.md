## Bug Fixes

### Boolean Property Identification Regression (#367)

Fixed regression from version 3.18.2 where boolean checkbox properties stopped working for property-based task identification.

During code refactoring, the `comparePropertyValues` function was accidentally removed, breaking boolean-to-string coercion needed for Obsidian checkbox properties. The fix restores this function with proper type-aware comparison logic, allowing boolean `true`/`false` frontmatter values to correctly match `"true"`/`"false"` setting values.

*Thanks to @renatomen for reporting this regression*
