# TaskNotes 3.16.3

## Bug Fixes

### User Interface

- **Create Task Modal Accessibility**: Fixed UI issues when creating tasks with natural language input disabled. The modal now opens in an expanded state with immediate access to all input fields, eliminating the need to click or tab before entering task details [#324] - Thanks to @nightroman for reporting this usability issue

### Timezone Handling

- **Recurring Task Calendar Display**: Fixed timezone-related display bug where recurring tasks appeared on the wrong day for users in negative UTC timezones. Tuesday tasks no longer incorrectly appear on Monday in the calendar view
- **Task Completion Calendar**: Improved timezone consistency in the TaskEditModal completion calendar to ensure dates display correctly across all timezones

### Task Conversion

- **Context Detection in Instant Tasks**: Fixed instant task conversion to properly detect and preserve contexts specified with "@context" syntax when converting inline tasks to TaskNotes [#320] - Thanks to @nslee123 for reporting this issue
- **Time Preservation**: Fixed instant task conversion to preserve time information when converting tasks with scheduled or due times. Time components are now correctly carried over during the conversion process

## Improvements

### Code Quality

- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive unit tests for InstantTaskConvertService context detection to ensure reliable context parsing in future releases
