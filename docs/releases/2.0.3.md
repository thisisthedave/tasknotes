
Bug Fixes:

Command Improvements:
- Removed layout-specific commands (open-linked-views, open-grid-layout, open-tabs-layout)
- Removed popout window commands for cleaner command palette
- Added 'Refresh TaskNotes cache' command for troubleshooting
- Simplified ribbon icons to focus on core functionality

Technical Details:
- Enhanced FilterService initial task set logic to include recurring tasks without due dates
- Modified getTaskPathsInDateRange() to check all recurring tasks for date range inclusion
- Added async processing with batched performance optimizations
- Maintained backward compatibility and existing performance characteristics
- Root cause: CacheManager only indexed tasks by actual due dates, excluding recurring tasks without due dates from date-based queries

The agenda view now correctly displays recurring tasks without due dates on their appropriate scheduled days.
