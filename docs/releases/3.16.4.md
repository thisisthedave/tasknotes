# TaskNotes 3.16.4

## Bug Fixes

### User Interface

- **Task Modal Title Field**: Fixed regression from version 3.16.3 where the title field was inadvertently removed from all task modals. The title field is now properly displayed with correct visibility logic:
  - Edit modals: Title field always visible in the details section
  - Create modals with natural language input enabled: Title field visible in details section (as the main input becomes the NLP textarea)
  - Create modals with natural language input disabled: Title field only appears at the top of the modal

This ensures users can always edit task titles regardless of the modal type or natural language input settings.
