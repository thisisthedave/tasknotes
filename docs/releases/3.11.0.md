# Release Notes: 3.11.0

This release introduces a new project management system, significant enhancements to the Pomodoro timer and workflows, and a number of quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes.

## New Features

### Project Management

A new project management system has been integrated, allowing for better organization and tracking of tasks within projects.

- **Note-Based Projects**: Projects are now properly integrated into TaskNotes. You can link tasks to any note in your vault, effectively turning that note into a project. This leverages Obsidian's core linking capabilities, allowing you to see all tasks related to a project in the backlinks of the project note.
- **Project Selection UI**: A new project selection modal has been added to the task creation and editing modals. It features fuzzy search to quickly find and assign tasks to project notes.
- **Filtering and Grouping by Project**:
    - The Filter Bar in all views now includes a "Project" filter, allowing you to see tasks for one or more specific projects.
    - The "Group By" option now includes "Project", which organizes the Task List and Kanban views by project.
- **Clickable Project Links**: In task cards and other views, project names are now clickable links that take you directly to the project note.

### Workflow and UI Enhancements

- **Redesigned Pomodoro Timer**: The Pomodoro timer has been completely redesigned for a more modern and user-friendly experience.
    - **New Interface**: A more compact and visually appealing interface.
    - **Time Adjustment**: You can now add or subtract time from the current session or the prepared timer.
    - **Skip Break**: A "Skip break" button is now available after a work session.
- **Enhanced Pomodoro Stats**: The Pomodoro statistics view has been improved to provide more insights.
    - **Overview Section**: A new overview section shows today's completed Pomodoros, total focus time, and a comparison with yesterday's performance.
- **Instant Task Conversion**: The "Convert task to TaskNote" command has been streamlined. It now instantly converts a checkbox task into a TaskNote without opening the creation modal, reducing friction.
- **Quick Actions for Current Task**: A new command, "Quick actions for current task," allows you to open the action palette for the currently active TaskNote, providing quick access to common operations.
- **Improved Sorting Logic**: The task sorting algorithm has been enhanced. When the primary sorting criterion (e.g., due date) is the same for multiple tasks, a fallback sorting order is applied: `scheduled date` -> `due date` -> `priority` -> `title`. This ensures a more predictable and logical ordering of tasks.
- **Archive Button in Edit Modal**: An "Archive" button has been added to the task edit modal, allowing for quick archiving and unarchiving of tasks.
- **Week Start Day Setting**: All calendar views now respect the "Start week on" setting from Obsidian's calendar preferences.

## Bug Fixes and Minor Improvements

- **Recurring Task Date Consistency**: A critical bug has been fixed where recurring task dates could appear on the wrong day in different timezones (especially CST). The handling of dates and timezones for recurring tasks is now more robust, ensuring consistency across all views.
- **Pomodoro Daily Note Integration**: The Pomodoro service now correctly handles adding session history to daily notes, preventing the creation of duplicate entries.
- **Template Processing**:
    - The `{{parentNote}}` template variable now correctly resolves to a properly formatted markdown link.
    - YAML frontmatter in templates is now processed more safely to avoid parsing errors.
- **Date Validation**: The `complete_instances` field for recurring tasks now has stricter validation to filter out invalid entries, improving data integrity.
- **Natural Language Processing**: The natural language parser now correctly applies scheduled times (e.g., "do something at 5pm") to created tasks.
- **Agenda View Quick Select**: A bug that prevented the date quick-select menus in the Agenda View from working after the first use has been fixed.
- **Styling and CSS**: Numerous styling improvements have been made across the plugin for a more polished and consistent look and feel, including to the Pomodoro views, task cards, and modals.
- **Documentation**:
    - The documentation has been updated to reflect the new project management features.
    - New workflow guides for "Habit Tracking" and "Project Management" have been added.
