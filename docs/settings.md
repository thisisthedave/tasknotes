# Settings

TaskNotes provides a variety of settings to customize its behavior and appearance. The settings are organized into several categories, each controlling a different aspect of the plugin.

## Task Defaults

These settings control the default properties for new tasks, such as the default status, priority, and folder location. You can also configure templates for new tasks, and set up filename generation patterns.

For more detailed information, see the [Task Defaults](settings/task-defaults.md) documentation.

## Inline Task Settings

These settings control the behavior of TaskNotes' inline task management features, such as the Task Link Overlay and Instant Task Conversion. You can also configure the natural language processor from this section.

For more detailed information, see the [Inline Task Settings](settings/inline-task-settings.md) documentation.

## Calendar Settings

These settings control the appearance and behavior of the calendar views, including the default view mode, time slot duration, and event visibility. You can also manage your external calendar subscriptions from this section.

For more detailed information, see the [Calendar Settings](settings/calendar-settings.md) documentation.

## Advanced Settings

These settings provide more advanced customization options, such as field mapping, custom status and priority workflows. You can also configure the Pomodoro timer from this section.

For more detailed information, see the [Advanced Settings](settings/advanced-settings.md) documentation.

## Misc Settings

These settings control various plugin features and display options, including status bar visibility, project subtasks widget, and performance tuning.

For more detailed information, see the [Misc Settings](settings/misc-settings.md) documentation.

## Property-based Identification (Boolean note)

If you identify task files by a frontmatter property, enter boolean values as true/false (without quotes) in Settings. Obsidian stores checkbox properties as real booleans; TaskNotes matches them correctly (e.g., setting "true" matches frontmatter `true`). See [Property-based Task Identification](settings/property-identification.md) for examples.
