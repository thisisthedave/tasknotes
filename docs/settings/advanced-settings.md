# Advanced Settings

These settings provide customization options, such as field mapping, custom status and priority workflows, and performance tuning.

## Field Mapping

**Field Mapping** allows you to customize the YAML property names that TaskNotes uses for its internal properties. This can be used for integrating with other plugins or for matching your existing vault structure. You can map all of the core task properties, including title, status, priority, and due date, as well as other properties like time estimates and recurrence patterns.

## Custom Status System

TaskNotes allows you to define your own **Custom Status Workflows**. You can create as many statuses as you need, and you can customize their names, colors, and completion behavior. You can also set the order in which the statuses appear, which determines the progression of the workflow.

## Custom Priority System

You can also create a **Custom Priority System**. You can define as many priority levels as you need, and you can customize their names, colors, and weights. The weight of a priority determines its importance, and is used for sorting and filtering.

## Performance Settings

TaskNotes includes **Performance Settings** to optimize the plugin for large vaults. You can disable the indexing of non-task notes, which can improve performance in vaults with a large number of notes.

## Pomodoro Timer Settings

You can configure the **Pomodoro Timer** from this section, including the duration of work and break sessions, as well as the notification settings. You can also choose where to store the Pomodoro session data.
