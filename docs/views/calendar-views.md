# Calendar Views

TaskNotes provides two calendar-based views for visualizing and managing your tasks: the **Mini Calendar** and the **Advanced Calendar**.

## Mini Calendar View

The Mini Calendar is a month-based view that shows which days have tasks. It is designed for navigation and for providing an overview of your task distribution.

## Advanced Calendar View

The Advanced Calendar is a calendar with multiple view modes (month, week, and day), drag-and-drop scheduling, and time-blocking capabilities. You can create new tasks by clicking on dates or time slots, and you can reschedule tasks by dragging them to a new date or time.

### FilterBar Integration

The Advanced Calendar View includes the same FilterBar functionality as the Task List View, allowing you to filter which tasks appear on the calendar and save views. See the [Task List View](task-list.md) documentation for complete FilterBar functionality details.
