# Calendar Views

TaskNotes provides two calendar-based views for visualizing and managing your tasks: the **Mini Calendar** and the **Advanced Calendar**.

## Mini Calendar View

The Mini Calendar is a month-based view that shows which days have tasks. It is designed for navigation and for providing an overview of your task distribution.

## Advanced Calendar View

The Advanced Calendar is a calendar with multiple view modes (month, week, and day), drag-and-drop scheduling, and time-blocking capabilities. You can create new tasks by clicking on dates or time slots, and you can reschedule tasks by dragging them to a new date or time.

### Recurring Task Support

The Advanced Calendar handles recurring tasks with proper all-day event support and allows duration updates through calendar resize operations. When dragging or resizing recurring task events, the changes apply to that specific occurrence while preserving the recurrence pattern.

### FilterBar Integration

The Advanced Calendar View includes the same FilterBar functionality as the Task List View, allowing you to filter which tasks appear on the calendar and save views. See the [Task List View](task-list.md) documentation for complete FilterBar functionality details.
