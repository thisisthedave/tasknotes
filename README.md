## Overview

TaskNotes treats each task as an individual Markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing the task's metadata (due date, status, priority, etc.) and the note body for additional context, descriptions, or progress notes. This creates a flexible system where tasks can be as simple or detailed as needed.

The plugin includes several views: calendar, kanban boards, filtered task lists, and a daily agenda. Tasks can link to projects using Obsidian's note linking. Recurring tasks track completion per instance.

You can track time on tasks with start/stop buttons and view session history. There's also a pomodoro timer that connects to tasks, with configurable work/break periods and stats.

## Rationale

Using YAML frontmatter for task storage has multiple benefits. YAML is a standard data format that works with many tools, so you can easily extract and transform your task data into other formats. This keeps your data portable and aligns with Obsidian's file-over-app philosophy.

The frontmatter is also extensible—you can add custom fields like "assigned-to" or "attachments" and use other tools like Obsidian Bases to work with that data. This flexibility made it easy to add features like time-tracking, which is tricky in other task formats where there's no obvious place to store timing information.

Since each task is a full note, you can write detailed descriptions, jot down thoughts as you work, and connect tasks to other notes through Obsidian's linking and graph features. The frontmatter compatibility with Bases also means you can use that plugin for different views and bulk operations if you want.

- **Templates**: Configure daily note templates with Obsidian variables

## YAML Structure

### Task Example
```yaml
title: "Complete documentation"
status: "in-progress"
due: "2024-01-20"
priority: "high"
contexts: ["work"]
projects: ["[[Website Redesign]]"]
timeEstimate: 120
timeEntries:
  - startTime: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    endTime: "2024-01-15T11:15:00Z"
```

### Recurring Task

```yaml
title: "Weekly meeting"
recurrence: "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO"
complete_instances: ["2024-01-08"]
```

## HTTP API

TaskNotes includes an optional HTTP API server for external integrations. This enables creating tasks from browsers, automation tools, mobile apps, and custom scripts.

### Quick Start

1. Enable the HTTP API in Settings → HTTP API tab (desktop only)
2. Configure port (default: 8080) and optional auth token  
3. Restart Obsidian to start the server

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health

# List all tasks
curl http://localhost:8080/api/tasks

# Create a task
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "New task", "priority": "High"}'

# Get task statistics
curl http://localhost:8080/api/stats
```

### Browser Integration

The API enables browser integrations:
- **Bookmarklets** for one-click task creation from any webpage
- **Browser extensions**: [for example](https://github.com/callumalpass/tasknotesbrowser-extension)
- **Automation** with Zapier, IFTTT, and similar services

### Documentation
